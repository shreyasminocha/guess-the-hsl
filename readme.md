# Guess the HSL

A simple game where your objective is to accurately guess the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) values of a given color swatch.

Similar to [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me)'s [_What the Color?_](https://leaverou.github.io/whathecolor), which I learned of soon after building this.

This also doubles up as my "hello-world" [svelte](https://svelte.dev) project.
